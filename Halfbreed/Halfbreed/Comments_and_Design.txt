A table for the actual save games themselves - may require more than 1.

Figure out how to store complex stuff in the database - probably serialization again.

Should swap new game so that it saves a new game and then calls load game.



Means:

On exit of level - save or continue.
All load games restart in the town hub for the chapter.
The deck should reset between levels as well.
Anathema is only for the current level and resets as well.
The variation within a level needs to increase to improve replayability.

So - what needs to get saved?

Achievements/Unlocks
Equipment/Items/Money
Abilities and setup

Means logging is only for the game experience for a single level.
