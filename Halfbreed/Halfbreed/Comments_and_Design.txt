Need to figure out how best to design this.
When should we check/assign things like paths, save file ids, etc.
Needs to work with both main game and testing environment.
Set starting parameters should really do only what it is supposed to do.
Have a generate id function - called from main menu when the game is created.

A Database for save games.
A table for the save game summaries.
A table for the actual save games themselves - may require more than 1.
These should all have a foreign key back to the main table.

The database is currently set to copy - eventually it should become an embedded resource.
This means it needs a wrapper to avoid changing many places.
