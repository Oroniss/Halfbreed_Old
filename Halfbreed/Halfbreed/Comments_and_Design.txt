Need to figure out how best to design this.
When should we check/assign things like paths, save file ids, etc.
Needs to work with both main game and testing environment.
Set starting parameters should really do only what it is supposed to do.
Have a generate id function - called from main menu when the game is created.

A Database for save games.
A table for the actual save games themselves - may require more than 1.
These should all have a foreign key back to the main table.

Figure out how to store complex stuff in the database - probably serialization again.

Should swap new game so that it saves a new game and then calls load game.
