A Database for save games.
A table for the actual save games themselves - may require more than 1.

Figure out how to store complex stuff in the database - probably serialization again.

Should swap new game so that it saves a new game and then calls load game.

Need to rejig the saving stuff so that it has it's own DB and DB connection class to
prevent overwrite on entity db updates.
