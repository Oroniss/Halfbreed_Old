Next Steps:


Dice and basic check mechanic - add player character class and initial ability setup here.
Actor primary stats.
Entity Defensive stats.
RNG and level generation - think about randomising turn order - in a reproducible way.
Get Description.
Also add beginning of an Examine function.
Add in actors.
Give player a simple attack.
Current effect.
Conditions.

Logging - figure out it's purpose.
Improve serialisation process.
The two things need to provide some degree of resilience in case of system crash/shutdown.
Also need to be there for debugging purposes.

Look for any situations which may be non-deterministic and which could affect state.

Powers:

Driven by training:

10 ranks of training improves the progression track/adds some effects.
Training requires a trainer and some xp to spend.
Training is for individual abilities, not just trees.

Generic stuff can go in the stat tree - other stuff should come on gear.

Stat gives the type of dice - (max of 5, extra dice are unupgraded d3s).
Equipment (or other gear) gives the defensive stats.
Defender always uses five dice and selects a number equal to the attacker, choosing the best.
Dice cancel each other one-for-one, rather than all contributing to a pool.
The faces for each die can be upgraded.

HL3: Vulnerability 1 nether.

A 1 subtracts 1 from every dice rolled - think through a bit more.

Upgrade - set path: 
First round +1: 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
Second round +1: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
Third round +1: 7, 8, 9.
Third round +2: 10, 11, 12.
Fourth round +3: 11, 12.
Fifth round +6: 12.

Ordering +1: 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 4, 7, 8, 5, 6, 9, 10, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 7, 8, 11, 12, 9.
Ordering +2: 12, 11, 10.
Ordering +3: 12, 11.
Ordering +6: 12.  

Final progression: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 18, 25.

Each ability/check needs to have a progression:
Win by 1 - x, 3, etc.

Gear then means: Chestpiece drives defensive abilities.
Weapon/shield drives offensive abilities.

Other gear drives defensive stats and hp.
Runes on the armour can upgrade the defensive dice.

140 dice upgrades - each character starts with 16 completed.
600 point upgrades

There needs to be a variety of other things to buy in each primary stat tree.
Passives, bonuses, re-rolls, flip dice, etc.

Non-combat skills get trained, but one track per skill - not per individual ability.
They serve as pre-requisites for various abilities, along with improving the track.
Tools and crafting stations also play a role.

Weapon/armour skills are now universal - everyone can use an equipment, although
different types tend to be more effective than others for certain classes.
They also use the main runes for their abilities - so they grant options instead of being required.
